        <p>
          <strong>Agentic AI systems:</strong>
          Highly adaptable systems with goal-oriented autonomy, designed to pursue complex goals with minimal human intervention,
          characterized by self-sufficiency and advanced decision making. Their applications consist of complex tasks with multiple objectives
          and the agents showcase multistep planning, meta-learning and inter-agent communication capabilities (Acharya et al., 2025; Sapkota et al., 2025).
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>AI Agents systems:</strong>
          More centered around the execution of a specific task, with supervised and rule-based learning mechanisms. Their planning and reasoning mechanisms are less advanced,
          showing restricted autonomy and proactivity. Moreover, the different agents utilized in the system operate independently from each other and learn and adapt within their specific domain
          (Sapkota et al., 2025).
